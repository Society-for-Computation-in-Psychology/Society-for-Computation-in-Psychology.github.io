      <description>In 1971, Donald Tepas, then at St. Louis University, contacted the National Science Foundation with a request for support in developing an interactive system for searches. The NSF representative Tepas looked into the possibility of arranging a conference and publishing the proceedings. The first meeting was so successful that the meetings have been held ever since! The logo featured on our homepage.
The Society for Computation in Psychology (SCiP) was previously known as the National Conference on the Use of On-Line Computers in Psychology.</description>
