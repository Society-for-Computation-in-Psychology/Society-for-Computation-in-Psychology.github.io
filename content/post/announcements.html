<p>If your university/job is covering the cost of the conference, consider covering the fees for us! (not necessary, just an option). If you use a paypal account, we will see the name associated with that account. If you pay directly with a credit card (no PayPal account necessary), your information will be grabbed from that page. If you are paying for someone else, please leave a note or send an email to <a href="mailto:compinpsych@gmail.com" class="email">compinpsych@gmail.com</a> so we can make name tags. We are registered 503(c), which makes your donation a tax exemption if you are in the United States! This registration also lowers the credit card/paypal fees. You can also pay by cash or check in person at the conference (US Dollars).</p>
