candidates here by August 15th, 2021.</p>
<p>[a] Steering Committee: We need to replace members of the Steering
Committee whose terms of office will end this year. The Society bylaws
specify that each member may nominate up to five persons for the
Steering Committee. The names of the six persons receiving the greatest
number of nominations, and who signify their willingness to serve on the
Steering Committee, will be placed on the election ballot. Elected
members will serve for a three-year term, and cannot be elected to two
consecutive terms. Self-nominations of qualified candidates are welcome.
[b] President: The Society bylaws specify that each member may nominate
up to two persons to serve as President-Elect. The names of three
persons receiving the greatest number of nominations, and who signify
their willingness to serve as President, will be placed on the election
ballot. The President will serve for 1 year, and will constitute part of
the Steering Committee as President-Elect and Past-President for 1 year
each. Past Presidents are not eligible for re-election as
President-Elect.</p>
<p>The 51st annual meeting of the Society for Computation in Psychology
(SCiP; formerly known as the Society for Computers in Psychology) is
pleased to announce its call for papers. The meeting will be held on
Thursday, November 4, 2021, before the opening of the annual meeting of
the Psychonomic Society. We invite you to submit your paper by August
31, 2021. We will be holding this event as a hybrid with both in person
and online presentations with more details to come as we learn them.</p>
<p>The theme for this year’s conference is 50 Years of Computation. As the
world increasingly relies on computation, we look back to the advances
and innovations from psychology and beyond. Submissions reflecting on
the history of advancement in their area are welcomed. We also encourage
our members to share this call with others who are doing related work
but who may not be regular SCiP attendees. To submit an abstract or

<p>What is SCiP?</p>
<p>If you are new to SCiP, it is an organization of researchers interested
in applications of computational techniques and methods in psychology.
This includes applications in educational technology, emerging research
methods, statistical analyses, web-based research, clinical
applications, and computational modeling. The Society has also
encouraged consideration of psychological aspects of hardware and
software development and design. Membership is open to any person who
has an academic degree and who is active in scientific applications of
computers to psychological research.</p>
<p>Program Information for the 2021 Conference</p>
<p>The program will include papers, tutorials, and symposia dealing with
the use of computers in all areas of psychological research, including
(but not limited to):</p>
<pre><code> Web-based research, data collection, and tools
 Online social media and communication
 Brain imaging methods and analysis

<p>You need not be a current member of SCiP to present at the conference,
and the modest conference registration fee also serves as your annual
membership dues.</p>
<p>Special Section of Behavior Research Methods</p>
<p>Conference presenters (both spoken and poster presentations) are invited
to submit articles based on presentations at the SCiP meeting to a
special section of Behavior Research Methods, the official journal of
the Society. Submissions should be prepared according to the guidelines
of BRM (see <a href="http://brm.psychonomic" class="uri">http://brm.psychonomic</a> journals.org/) and submitted
through the BRM submission portal. It is important to indicate that the
submission is for the “SCiP Issue.” in the online portal. Submissions
are reviewed and published in an online collection, and therefore, they
can be submitted at any time.</p>
<p>Student Awards</p>
<p>First-time graduate student presenters are strongly encouraged to submit
abstracts. If you are a first-time graduate student attending SCiP, and
the primary presenter, you may be eligible to have your registration
waived as part of the Birnbaum Scholarship for first-time graduate
presenters. Please contact our Executive Director, Erin Buchanan at
compinpsych@gmail.com for details. Please note that if you missed out
last year, you are eligible this year!</p>
<p>The Society sponsors The Castellan Student Paper Award for the
outstanding student paper. Student papers on the application of
computers to any area of psychology (theoretical, experimental, applied)
are welcome. Eligibility is open to work done by a student currently
enrolled in undergraduate or graduate courses, or work done as part of a
course, thesis, or other student research by a person who graduated
within the last year. The student must be the primary author and the
presenter of the paper. The winning author will receive a one year
membership in the Society, a one year subscription to BRM, and a $200
cash prize.</p>
<p>Students who wish to have their papers considered for the award should
indicate their desire at the time of submission and are required to
submit the complete manuscript for evaluation for the competition by
October 1, 2021. The award for the outstanding student paper will be
presented at the conference during the business meeting.</p>
